# Pathfinder 2e combat engine

A headless, deterministic rules engine for Pathfinder Second Edition (Remaster) encounters. Rules come from [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/); each module links the pages it implements.

## Status

Milestones 1–2 of the design doc are in:

- **Dice and checks**: seeded dice, modifier stacking, proficiency, the four degrees of success, natural 1/20, degree adjusters, flat checks.
- **Strike loop**: character and monster statistics, AC, multiple attack penalty (agile), damage rolls (minimum 1, crit doubling, deadly, fatal, striking runes), immunity / weakness / resistance, temporary HP, massive damage.
- **Battle**: initiative (enemies win ties), rounds, three Strikes a turn, a full replayable log.

Next up: milestone 3 (action economy, reactions, durations, Delay and Ready), then conditions and dying, then the grid.

## Usage

Requires Node 22.18 or newer, which runs the TypeScript sources directly.

```sh
npm install
npm test            # unit tests, each tied to the rule it checks
npm run typecheck
npm run duel -- 42 3   # seed 42: Valeros (level 1 fighter) vs 3 goblin warriors
```
